        "Protein folding is a very important problem, as proteins are the basic building blocks of everything alive on Earth, including our bodies. Proteins work together like miniature machines to execute many functions in our bodies, from transmitting signals and providing structure to our cells to working as chemical factories and peacekeepers of our bodies. Proteins start their lives as one-dimensional chains of amino acids, but then they “fold” into 3D shapes. It is similar to how in origami you fold a 2D sheet of paper into a 3D crane or a unicorn, but proteins are even simpler than 2D, they start as 1D sequences. Understanding how proteins acquire 3D structure is one of the most difficult and unsolved problems in biology. We get the 1D sequence of a protein from its DNA or RNA, but it is very difficult to predict what shape it will take when it folds into a 3D structure. Scientists are currently using machine learning to get closer to understanding this important biological question.\n",
