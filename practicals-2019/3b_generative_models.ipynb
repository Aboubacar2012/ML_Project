    "For this practical, we will use the Fashion MNIST dataset consisting of 70,000 greyscale images of clothing items and their labels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. However, unlike in the *supervised learning* setting that we have been exposed to in the previous practicals, because we are doing *unsupervised learning* in this practical, we will not make use of the labels. In this practical, our goal is not to learn labels for images, but rather to learn to generate (hopefully) new and unique images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding our task of generating images, you may be wondering why we care about doing this! One simple reason we're spending time on this is that it is a fun application of generative models, which gives us an excellent visual way of exploring how different models work. However, generating images itself has many interesting applications ranging from creating new fonts to making people smile in pictures, and from assisting with interactive design to creating photo-realistic images from drawn outlines (see [this cool article](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) for more information on these applications). It should also be noted that many of the techniques presented in this practical apply to generative modelling in general and not just to generating images. Generative modelling has many interesting applications ranging from anomaly detection to missing data imputation, as well as, in leveraging abundant unsupervised data for representation learning (e.g. [BigBiGAN](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02544) and [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805))."

    "[Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) (GANs), are a very popular class of deep generative models which have shown some incredible results in generating images. For example, take a look at the progress that has been made in generating pictures of people's faces, taken from Ian Goodfellow's [twitter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/1084973596236144640&sa=D&ust=1565613603406000&usg=AFQjCNEtcXzfgDqPL0vPBkDJhl-x2Iup_Q_):\n",

    "The idea behind GANs is to train two networks simultaneously. Firstly, a **generator network**, which we can train to take a random input (often called $z$) and produce a sample from some distribution, in this case, the distribution of 28 x 28 grayscale clothing images. Secondly, we have a **discriminator network**, which will learn to tell apart the real (training) data and the fake (generated) data. The generator is trained to trick the discriminator and the discriminator is trained to avoid being tricked. This process is described in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![GAN](https://i.imgur.com/OUPd4Av.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the above diagram, the discriminator's loss is calculated from using the labels (real or fake) for the generated and training images. We can use the standard cross-entropy loss function for a binary classifier. However, more interestingly, the generator's loss comes from performing back-propagation through the discriminator. In a sense, **the discriminator is the loss function for the generator**. While it may seem strange to train a neural network using another neural network as the loss function, rather than some pre-defined function, it turns out that training this way approximately minimizes something called the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD), which is a well motivated choice of loss function for generative models that we would be unable to calculate analytically.\n"

Of course, in practice, we do not necessarily have an optimal discriminator, and so we end up with some approximation of the JSD. \n",

    "You should already be starting to notice some of the differences between generative and discriminative models. For example, we've said that we are now doing unsupervised learning and that we do not need labels for our data. So you might now be wondering if this is always the case and whether there are other differences between the two kinds of models. In general, *generative models are not always unsupervised*; they can also be supervised or even semi-supervised. In these cases, labels are often used. Similarly, unsupervised learning is not always generative, for example, k-means clustering. The main difference between generative and discriminative modelling is the goal. The purpose of a discriminative model is to predict an output $y$ given an input $x$, as acurately as possible. On the other hand, the purpose of a generative model is to describe the process in which data is generated. This lets us create new examples of the data, often written $\\hat x$, but it can also help us to understand the underlying nature of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarise the above by saying discriminative models learn $p(y | x)$, whilst generative models learn *something* about $p(x)$. But what do we mean by 'something'? Let's get an idea by taking a look at what a few different kinds of models learn:\n",

    "VAEs, also known as the [Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) method, are extensions of a kind of neural network architecture called an autoencoder (AE). We'll start by building and training an autoencoder. After we've done that, we'll introduce a few changes that make an AE into a VAE. \n",

    "Autoencoders are networks trained unsupervised on input data (often images) that attempt to find a simple *code* to represent the input data. The main idea is to jointly train two sub-networks to cooperate: the *encoder* network, which takes an image and turns it into a code, and the *decoder* network, which takes a code and turns it back into a reconstructed image. (For non-image data, the basic idea is the same). The code is often called the *latent code* or *latent variable*, which lives in a *latent space*. The latent code uses the symbol $\\mathbf z$, whereas data typically uses the symbol $\\mathbf x$, and the reconstructed data uses the symbol $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. In the case of MNIST, the input data is made of $28\\times28$ grayscale images. A typical latent code might be 100 dimensional, but the exact size is a hyperparameter that can be tuned &#8212; the only thing that matters is that it is smaller than the input dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "![autoencoder](https://i.imgur.com/yj8f5jS.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want to learn a latent code for the data? There are a number of applications. An obvious one is that it allows us to *compress* our data, in a process called *dimensionality reduction*. By making the dimensionality of our latent code smaller than that of the data, we force the model to compress the important pieces of information into the code and discard the unimportant information. Another application is *representation learning*, which we mentioned briefly in the introduction. The idea behind representation learning is that we want different parts of our code to represent different aspects of our data. For example, one dimension of the code might represent whether or not a person is smiling, while another might represent a person's hair colour. Learning good representations of our data not only allows us to have fine control over the images we generate but also lets us build powerful image classifiers.\n",

The perfect autoencoder will yield $\\mathbf{\\hat x} = \\mathbf{x}$, or equivalently $d(e(\\mathbf{x})) = \\mathbf{x}$, meaning that the input can be reconstructed perfectly from the code. Therefore we can train an autoencoder to minimize a reconstruction loss which is the difference between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$.

However, this isn't always a bad thing. In some cases, when we have noisy images, we might want to throw away the noisy parts of the inputs. In this light, *autoencoders can be seen as a non-linear form of PCA*. In fact, in the case of single-layer encoders and decoders with tied weights, we  are doing ordinary PCA.\n",

More specifically, it produces the distribution $p(z|x)$. Then, given samples from this distribution, **the decoder generates new input data samples**. In other words, we have learnt a latent variable model for the data.

Similarly, while the posterior samples do look something like the corresponding test dataset images, there is plenty of room for improvement. That said, it should be clear that we have successfully trained a VAE to model images of clothing if we compare the prior samples here to the random samples we tried to take from the standard autoencoder."
