    "When modelling an image using a regular feed-forward network, we find that the number of model parameters grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QUESTION**: How many parameters would there be in a feed-forward network with 2 hidden layers consisting of 512 and 256 neurons respectively, an output size of 10 and an input image of shape [32, 32, 3]? (Note that we represent each pixel in a colour image using three real-numbers for the Red, Green and Blue values -- [called \"channels\"](https://www.quora.com/What-do-channels-refer-to-in-a-convolutional-neural-network) -- and hence the 32x32**x3** shape.)\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNets address this model parameter issue by exploiting structure in the inputs to the network (in particular, by making the assumption that the input is a 3-D *volume*, which applies to images for example, where the 3 dimensions consist of the three RGB channels). The two key differences between a ConvNet and a Feed-forward network are:\n",

    "* ConvNets have neurons that are arranged in 3 dimensions: width, height, depth. Note that *depth* here means channels, i.e. the depth of the input volume, not the depth of a deep neural network!\n",

    "A 2-dimensional convolutional layer maps an input *volume* (meaning, a 3-D input tensor, e.g. [width, height, channels]) to an output *volume* through a set of learnable filters, which make up the parameters of the layer. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. (Eg: A filter in the first layer of a ConvNet might have size [5, 5, 3]). During the forward pass, we convolve (\"slide\") each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute element-wise dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Each convolutional layer will have such a set of filters, and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We then stack these activation maps along the depth-dimension to produce the output volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these filters which map to a small sub-volume of the input, we can to a large extent, control the parameter explosion that we would get with a (fully-connected) feed-forward network. This **parameter sharing** actually also tends to improve the performance of the model on inputs like natural images because it provides the model with some limited **translation invariance**. Translation invariance means that if the image (or a feature in the image) is translated (moved), the model will not be significantly affected. Think about why this is the case!\n",

The colours of the edges represent the value of the weight parameters in the layers. For the fully-connected layer, the number of weights is the product of the input and output sizes, in this case, $6 \\times 4 = 24$. On the other hand, the number of weights in the convolutional layer depends only on the filter size of the convolution, in this case, $3$, and is independent of the input and output sizes.\n",

    "One of the reasons that CNNs have been so successful is their ability to build up complex filters by composing more simple filters. For example, imagine a 5 layer CNN that has been trained to detect faces.

We might find that the filters in each convolution layer pick out the following features:\n",

The following diagram (adapted from [this paper](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~honglak/icml09-ConvolutionalDeepBeliefNetworks.pdf)) shows some really cool examples of this kind of behaviour. The lower level features (shown above) detect noses, eyes, and mouths, in the case of faces, and wheels, doors, and windows, for cars.

    "A pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the representation. There are different reasons why we may want to do this. One is to reduce the number of parameters in the network. Imagine a convnet for the MNIST dataset. If the feature tensor produced by the final conv/pool/relu layer was say, of size 20x20 and had 100 feature channels, the final dense layer would have 20x20x100x10=400k parameters. However, if we down-sampled that layer to a 4x4 spatial size, we would have only 20k parameters. A big difference!\n",

    "Another reason is that we want later features (deeper in the network) to have larger *receptive fields* (input regions that they look at), in order to represent bigger objects and object parts for instance. In particular, pooling stride gives later features much larger receptive fields so that they can effectively combine smaller features together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pooling layer has no trainable parameters. It applies some 2-D aggregation operation (usually a max(), but others like average() may also be used) to regions of the input volume. This is done independently for each depth dimension of the input. For example, a 2x2 max pooling operation with a stride of 2, downsamples every depth slice of the input by 2 along both the width and height.\n",

In this case, we have just been using the default Keras initializers for each layer, which are usually sufficient.\n",

    "\n",
    " * The deeper neural networks become the more likely it is that gradients will either shrink to the point that they vanish, or grow to the point that they overflow (the _vanishing_ and _exploding_ gradients problems). To help combat this we can initialize our weights to have a (model-specific) appropriate scale. One method for doing this is called [Xavier or Glorot](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) initialization.\n",

    " * The _Xavier_ initialization scheme was designed with the _traditional_ activations Sigmoid and TanH in mind and does not work as well for ReLU activations. An alternative is [He or Kaiming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01852.pdf) initialization which is a modification of Xavier initialization for ReLU activations.\n",

On top of that, one also has to make decisions such as what kind of pooling, which activation functions, and what size of convolution to use, among other things. For new and old practitioners of deep learning, these choices can be overwhelming. \n",

    "\n",
    "[This article](https://medium.com/@sidereal/cnns-architectures-lenet-alexnet-vgg-googlenet-resnet-and-more-666091488df5) describes many of the most successful CNN architectures in recent years, including [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [Inception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf) and [VGG](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf). For a more detailed and technical description of these models and more see [these slides](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2017/cs231n_2017_lecture9.pdf). Reading through these resources should give you insights into why these architectures are successful as well as best practices and current trends for CNNs that will help you design your own architectures.\n",

    "For example, one of the practices you might pick up on is the use of 3x3 convolutions. You'll notices that older architectures such as [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) used a range of convolutions from 7x7 down to 3x3. However, newer architectures such as VGG and ResNet use 3x3 convolutions almost exclusively. In short, the reason is that stacking 3x3 convolutions gives you the same receptive field as a larger convolution but with more non-linearity. \n",
