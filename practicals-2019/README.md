# Khipu Practicals 2019

This repository contains the practical notebooks for Khipu 2019, held in Universidad de la Rep√∫blica in Montevideo.

See [www.khipu.ai](www.khipu.ai) for more details.


# How to use this repository.

The notebooks in the root directory are meant to be used for the practical sessions.
There will be two sessions per day, and the days are enumerated in the notebook's name.

Additionally, the [background](background) directory has some notebooks that can be used by attendees to prepare for the meeting.

Each notebook can be opened in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) through the button on the top of each file.
They are all meant to be used with Colab's free resources.
